Instructions
============

In general all you need to do is load up hobbing_jig_plate.stl and print that one time. If you prefer to do two prints then print ratchet_gear_4.stl followed by block_4.stl

* Place a bolt into the ratchet gear so that the bolt head sits flush with the gear. 
* Insert the bolt into the jig block.
* if you have one, insert a 608 bearing into the jig, and snug it in with a nut and washer
* secure the jig in a vice, or clamp. (or hold it if you feel brave)
* use a rotary tool to grind your first tooth into the bolt
* rotate the bolt clockwise one notch
* use a rotary tool to grind tooth into the bolt
* rotate and repeat
